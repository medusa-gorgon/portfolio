# Portfolio

This project was created based on a Retro Portfolio design and is focused on responsive + adaptive markup.

## Getting started

After cloning this project locally you'll need to install Node 10.0.0 version or lower as it contains a lot of deprecated packages. For Windows you can do it using [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

After installation run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
gulp
```
